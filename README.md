#Task Manager

A site used to manage personal tasks. Tasks are grouped in a group of tasks and the percentage of completed tasks will be shown for every group. Basically a glorified note writer that allows for some organizing.
Was intended to eventually be able to make a complete group based on someone's trophy list with the help of the PS-api (https://github.com/Tustin/psn-php)
